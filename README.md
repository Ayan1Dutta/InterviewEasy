# PeerPrep

PeerPrep is a real-time collaborative technical interview & practice platform featuring:

- Multi-language synchronized code editor (JavaScript / Java / C++)
- Batched operational deltas + versioned full snapshot reconciliation for consistency
- Per-language persistent storage (MongoDB) with local fallback
- Real-time language switching with isolated Monaco models
- Integrated WebRTC video calling with full session reset handling
- Shared execution output (Piston API) & collaborative notes
- Session lifecycle management (join/leave/end, host controls)

## Quick Start
Backend: install deps and run server (port configured in code)
Frontend: `npm install` then `npm run dev` inside `frontend/`

## Naming Rationale
PeerPrep conveys peer-to-peer preparation for interviewsâ€”short, memorable, and purpose driven.
